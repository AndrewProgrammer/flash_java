//operator like sizeof(C++) (but not exactly) instanceof:
The java instanceof operator is used to test whether the object is an instance 
of the specified type (class or subclass or interface).


interface Domestic {}
class Animal {}
class Dog extends Animal implements Domestic {}
class Cat extends Animal implements Domestic {}
Imagine a dog object, created with Object dog = new Dog(), then:

dog instanceof Domestic // true - Dog implements Domestic
dog instanceof Animal   // true - Dog extends Animal
dog instanceof Dog      // true - Dog is Dog
dog instanceof Object   // true - Object is the parent type of all objects
However, with Object animal = new Animal();,

animal instanceof Dog // false
because Animal is a supertype of Dog and possibly less "refined".

And,

dog instanceof Cat // does not even compile!
